# Runtime registry — the runtimes every -craft team may run a pass on, and how a new one earns its way in

First copy, built on the Productcraft build map's [Runtime registry and model-trial protocol](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/286) ticket (2026-09-21) from two tier-audited research briefs ([harnesses per runtime](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/blob/14096e6c/vault/20_projects/research/2026-09-21-harnesses-per-runtime.md), [the Pi harness](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/blob/14096e6c/vault/20_projects/research/2026-09-21-pi-harness-and-extension-ecosystem.md)) and the rulings already in force ([per-seat model delegation, #267](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/267); [evals-and-trace design, #272](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/272) decision 9). Shared law since 2026-10-01 ([craftwork build 1](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/324), moved from `productcraft/templates/`): every -craft team's coordinator names its runtimes from these rows, Systemcraft since its adoption on 2026-10-01 ([craftwork build 4](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/327)).

**What this file is for.** Seat identity is already separate from runtime: the one-invocation-one-seat rule puts the seat contract, lane manifest and target in the prompt, and each seat file's `model:` line names the runtime that actually runs. Swapping a runtime is therefore a one-line seat-file edit plus a launch form the coordinator knows. This is the table of launch forms — and the standing each runtime has earned, so that an unmeasured runtime never becomes a seat baseline by drift.

**Rulings ratified by Sean, 2026-09-22** (adopted by recommendation on 2026-09-21, ratified as written): the row shape below; one `meter_source` value per row in the trace kit's vocabulary, held equal by a test; Aider off the registry; Jev off the registry as a seat runtime; Pi's isolated-home form with an owner-authored `SYSTEM.md`, with the subscription-auth bridges off until their terms are answered. Overruling any of them is a dated edit to its row, not a re-litigation of #267.

**Re-ruled by Sean, 2026-09-29** ([#321](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/321)): the Agent tool's `opus` / `sonnet` aliases had moved to Opus 5.5 / Sonnet 5.5 after the first train closed, so row 1 could no longer launch the ruled baselines. Sean chose to re-rule the bench to the 5.5 generation, not to substitute for one train or pin the old ids headless. Row 1's standing carries the new models with zero labeled passes; the numbers below stay filed under the model each pass actually ran on. Two guards came with the ruling: the coordinator probes each alias at Route, and the trace kit's rung-0 line 11 fails a record whose `runtime:` disagrees with its transcript's model stamps. The same probe found row 2's `--bare` flag drops the login, so that form could never have run as written.

**Ruled by Sean, 2026-10-03** ([Open-model and harness trials, #287](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/287)): the count floor for `baseline-eligible` (§ Standing), the per-trial cash cap and its key (§ The trial protocol, step 2), seat families for Systemcraft's five seats (two of them new: `architecture`, `trust design`), and the first trial round with its scoreboard, set before anything runs (§ First trial round).

## A row is a route, not a model

One row per **harness × provider route**. The model and its effort are parameters of a pass — pinned in the seat file for a baseline, in the Route entry for a deviation, in the trial record for a trial — and the record's `runtime:` string carries them. The string convention per row is in the table, so that the registry numbers group correctly across engagements: the model as it ran, prefixed by the route only when the route changes who serves the model.

## The rows

| # | Route | `runtime:` string | Launch form (verbatim; values per pass) | Sandbox and disk | Reads corpus + ledger | `meter_source` | Tier steps on the #267 ladder | Standing | Installed here (2026-09-21) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Claude Code, Agent tool | `claude-<model>` — `claude-opus-5-5`, `claude-sonnet-5-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`; `claude-fable-5-1` only for the interactive coordinator's own session; always the transcript's model stamp, never the alias | `Agent tool, fresh context, model=<opus\|sonnet\|haiku>, subagent_type=general-purpose` — the alias resolves to whatever the harness ships; probe it at Route (#321) | the session's permission mode; the subagent's tools | yes — the working directory | `Agent-tool usage` (one total) | Sonnet 5.5 → Opus 5.5 → row 3; Haiku 4.5 is the downshift floor, never a baseline; Fable only on Sean's word for a named pass | **ruled** (#267; re-ruled to the 5.5 generation on #321, 2026-09-29): Opus 5.5 baseline for four Productcraft seats, Sonnet 5.5 for three; Systemcraft re-ruled to the same generation on #327 (2026-10-01), Opus 5.5 for three seats and Sonnet 5.5 for two; 0 labeled passes yet. `claude-opus-5` / `claude-sonnet-5` retired from baseline the same day: still served (row 2's form reaches them), no longer reachable through this row's aliases, their pc-eng-001 passes stay filed under their own strings | Claude Code 2.1.283 |
| 2 | Claude Code, headless | as row 1, plus any exact model id the provider still serves (`claude-opus-5` answered as itself, 2026-09-29) | `claude -p --output-format json --model <model> --permission-mode acceptEdits --allowedTools "Read,Write,Edit" --add-dir <repo> --max-budget-usd <n> "<prompt>"` — **no `--bare`**: it drops the OAuth login ("Not logged in", probe 2026-09-29) | `acceptEdits` inside the working directories; without `--bare` the session loads the repo's hooks, plugins, memory and CLAUDE.md, which breaks fresh context until an isolation form is proven (#287) | yes | `claude -p result.usage` (split pair; also `total_cost_usd`, `duration_ms`; `modelUsage` names the model that answered) | as row 1 | as row 1 for the model; **the form is unverified** — no seat pass has run on it; the first proves the meter line and the isolation | Claude Code 2.1.283 |
| 3 | Codex CLI on OpenAI | `codex <model> <effort>` — `codex gpt-5.6-sol high` | `codex exec --json --model gpt-5.6-sol -c model_reasoning_effort="high" --sandbox workspace-write --skip-git-repo-check -C <repo> -o <eng>/trace/logs/pass-NN.last.md "$(cat <eng>/trace/logs/pass-NN.prompt.md)" < /dev/null > <eng>/trace/logs/pass-NN.jsonl 2> <eng>/trace/logs/pass-NN.err` | `workspace-write` with `-C <repo>`: reads anywhere the user can, writes inside the repo | yes — corpus and ledger sit inside the repo, gitignored | `codex turn.completed.usage` (split pair, from the JSONL); `codex footer` when the plain form is used (one total, on stderr) | high → xhigh → stop and ask Sean; `ultra` forbidden (auto-delegates, breaks one-invocation-one-seat) | **ruled** (#267): the escalation target and the default gate vendor; 3 labeled passes on pc-eng-001, 3 pass, rung-0 clean | codex-cli 0.146.0 |
| 4 | Codex CLI → OpenRouter | `codex/openrouter <model> [<effort>]` | row 3's form with `-p openrouter -m <model>` and a `$CODEX_HOME/openrouter.config.toml` holding `[model_providers.openrouter] name = "OpenRouter" base_url = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" env_key = "OPENROUTER_TRIALS_API_KEY" wire_api = "responses"` — the trials' own capped key (§ The trial protocol, step 2), never the council's | as row 3 | yes | as row 3 | none — a trial runtime has no tier (below) | **unmeasured**; the wiring is expressible and **unverified**: Codex's Responses-only client against OpenRouter's stateless Responses endpoint is #287's first experiment | codex-cli 0.146.0; API-billed |
| 5 | Codex CLI → Ollama | `codex/ollama <model>` (host in the launch form, not the string) | row 3's form with `--oss --local-provider ollama -m <model>`, or `-p ollama-launch` over `[model_providers.ollama-launch] base_url = "http://<host>:11434/v1/" wire_api = "responses"`; the model needs a ≥64K-context tag | as row 3 | yes | as row 3 | none | **unmeasured**; which models tool-call under `--oss` beyond `gpt-oss` is not established; local fit is arithmetic until a pass runs at the quant it would ship at | codex-cli 0.146.0; Ollama 0.35.1 on the MBP (2026-10-03, an M4 Pro 48 GB, not the M4 Max the #300 note assumed), 0.34.1 on Mac Mini and Alienware (day-gated) at 2026-09-21; `qwen3.8-27b-64k` built on the MBP from [its Modelfile](../trace/ollama/Modelfile.qwen3.8-27b-64k) |
| 6 | Pi | `pi/<provider> <model>` — `pi/openrouter glm-5.3`, `pi/ollama qwen3.8-27b` | `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR=craftwork/trace/pi-home pi -p --mode json --offline -na --no-context-files --no-skills --no-extensions -e craftwork/trace/pi-home/seat.ts --tools read,write,edit,ls --session-dir <eng>/trace/logs --model <provider>/<model> "<prompt>"` | no sandbox by design — the host user's permissions; tools cut to `read,write,edit,ls` so every corpus read is a `read` call in the session JSONL; an isolated home keeps personal extensions, skills and memory add-ons out | yes | `pi message_end usage` (split pair per assistant message, summed by the owner extension; the session JSONL holds the same numbers) | none | **unmeasured**; the seat brief lives in the home's `SYSTEM.md` (owner-authored, no `<docs>` section reaches a seat); OpenRouter built in; Ollama through `models.json`, no provider extension unless the tool-call-streaming claim proves true (#287 experiment) | not installed |
| 7 | Hermes | `hermes/<provider> <model>` | `hermes chat --oneshot -q "<prompt>" --format stream-json --usage-file <eng>/trace/logs/pass-NN.usage.json` with `agent.disabled_toolsets: [memory]` in its config and `terminal.backend: local` | the host user's permissions (`local` backend); the memory toolset **off** — cross-session memory breaks the fresh-context rule every audit runs under | yes | `hermes usage-file` (split pair, cache, reasoning, `auxiliary`, written even on failure; the record takes the top-level main-loop numbers) | none | **unmeasured**; the `-z` path hides tool activity, so `--oneshot` + `stream-json` is the raw log; ≥64K context | not installed |
| 8 | Gemini CLI | `gemini <model>` | `gemini -p "<prompt>" --output-format json -m <model> --approval-mode yolo --include-directories <repo>` | file tools confined to the workspace root plus included directories; sandbox off unless flagged | yes | `gemini stats.tokens` (`prompt` + `candidates` per model → input / output; `cached`, `thoughts`, `tool` beside them) | none | **unmeasured**; Google models only — no other provider is documented | gemini 0.1.9, which lacks these flags — upgrade before the first pass |

**Candidates that are not rows yet.** OpenCode (`opencode run --format json --model provider/model --auto`) carries a pass and reaches OpenRouter and Ollama, but its `step_finish` token and cost fields were not confirmed in primary sources; it becomes a row when someone reads that schema from source and names its `meter_source` value. A row without a source-confirmed meter is not a row.

**Two local facts every Codex row carries** (#300, probes of 2026-09-21). `~/.codex/config.toml` pins `model = "gpt-6-astra"`, which the installed 0.146.0 rejects with HTTP 400 — so a pass **always** passes `--model`, never inherits the default, and `gpt-6-astra` stays a dated owner-approved substitution only once a Codex upgrade accepts it. And this machine's plugin load trips Codex's 2% skills budget: the isolation recommended is a seat `CODEX_HOME` carrying the auth file and a seat config, so no personal skill or plugin reaches a seat prompt. That isolation is **unverified**; the plain form ran three passes on pc-eng-001 and remains valid. Which of `CODEX_HOME` and `--ignore-user-config` actually clears the budget is settled as the **setup of the first trial round's trial 1** (#287): the coordinator verifies it from the logs, no label, and the form that works replaces this paragraph's recommendation.

## Standing — how a runtime earns its way in

Every row carries one of four standings. The first is a ruling; the other three are earned on the evals ladder (#272 decision 9), in order, and a runtime never skips one.

| Standing | What it means | What it permits | How it is reached |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ruled** | Placed by a ratified ruling (#267 today): the seat baselines and the escalation target | Whatever the ruling says: a seat `model:` line, a ladder tier, a gate vendor | Sean's ratification on a map ticket; re-ruled the same way |
| **unmeasured** | Registered, with a launch form and a meter source, and no labeled pass on real work | A **trial** (a shadow pass beside a live engagement's pass, labeled blind); or a **dated, owner-approved substitution** under the availability ladder on Sean's word for a named pass, with `standing: unmeasured` in the Route entry. Never a seat baseline, never a ladder tier, never a gate vendor | Its row lands here with a source-confirmed `meter_source` |
| **substitution-eligible** | One blind-labeled, rung-0-clean trial pass on real work | The coordinator may **propose** it at Route as the substitution for an unavailable runtime — still dated, still owner-approved; a promoted trial output enters the train under rule 7 | The trial's row in the labels file carries `pass`, the checker names no finding on it, and its runtime is on the § Numbers table below. `UNMEASURED` on that pass is honest and does not block this standing; it blocks the next |
| **baseline-eligible** | Enough measured, labeled passes in a seat family that a seat file may name it | A seat's `model:` line, by a dated edit that names the numbers it rests on; a ladder position only by a new ruling | Rung 1 applied to its fails (every fail coded against the studio's taxonomy, which is the shared [trace/taxonomy.md](../trace/taxonomy.md) plus the studio's own file, e.g. [Productcraft's](../../productcraft/trace/taxonomy.md), or honestly uncodeable) **plus the count floor** (#287, 2026-10-03): **10 labeled passes in that seat family, every one rung-0 clean, at least 8 of them `pass`**. Ten because the registry prints no rate below ten passes and below it an 80% runtime cannot be told from a lucky one. Trials and ordinary passes both count; passes in another family never do |

A trial runtime has **no tier**: escalation is defined on the ratified ladder only, and the baseline pass a trial shadows is what the train carries, so a failed trial is a labeled fail and nothing else — never a redraft one tier up on the trial's own row. A row records its runtime's own effort steps (Codex `high` / `xhigh`; a `:thinking` suffix on Pi; Claude's model steps) so a future ruling has a named step to point at, but naming a step is not a tier.

## The trial protocol

How a runtime moves from a row to a number, on real work only (#287's constraint: every experiment is a unit of work Sean would keep).

1. **Register** — the row above with its launch form, sandbox, provider pinning, disk reach and a source-confirmed `meter_source`; the value is added to `METER_SOURCES` in [trace/tracekit/engagement.py](../trace/tracekit/engagement.py) in the same change, or the drift test fails. Standing: unmeasured.
2. **Declare at Open** — a trial is named in the engagement's pass budget as a shadow of a specific planned pass (`shadow_of`), and does not count against the funded cap: it is beside the train, never in it. An API-billed row (4, 8 on an API key, and 6 on OpenRouter) states a per-trial cash cap in the same line: **$15 per trial** (#287). The backstop is the key, not the harness, since neither Codex nor Pi has a budget flag: OpenRouter trials run on a dedicated key (`craft-trials`, a **$30 credit limit** set in OpenRouter, read from `OPENROUTER_TRIALS_API_KEY` in the repo's `.env`; Pi's launch sets `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` from it), so trial spend never touches the LLM Council's key or caps. A trial that hits the cap stops and is recorded **incomplete**: kept, unlabeled, never a fail.
3. **Fire on identical inputs** — `kind: trial`, the same input hashes as the baseline pass, the row's launch form verbatim, its artifact written under `trace/trials/`, `## Moves` included. The record's `runtime:` string follows the row's convention. A gate or audit of the trial runs on a different lineage than its author, like any pass.
4. **Label blind** — the viewer hides the runtime, launch form and log path of both passes until both rows carry a verdict (rung-0 line 9 enforces it). Sean labels both as he reads.
5. **Promote or keep** — a trial whose blind label passes while the baseline's fails is *promotable*; promoting it is a dated, owner-approved substitution under rule 7, noted on both records, with one line beginning `promoted: <date>` in the trial record's `## Notes` — the registry numbers read that line and nothing else. An unpromoted trial is still kept work: its artifact and label stay in the engagement.
6. **Count at Close** — `python3 craftwork/trace/registry.py productcraft/ledger/engagements/pc-eng-*` regenerates § Numbers; the coordinator replaces the section with the output. Counts only: the design forbids a percentage below ten passes and the generator prints none at any count. A standing changes only when the numbers say so, by an edit to the row that names them.

The same six steps govern a **launch-form** change on an existing runtime (row 2, or row 3's `--json` form over the footer): the first pass on the new form is an ordinary pass whose meter line proves the wiring, not a trial, because the runtime did not change.

## Numbers

<!-- generated by craftwork/trace/registry.py — replace the block below at every Close; never edit a number by hand -->

Engagements read: pc-eng-001, pc-eng-002. Counts, never percentages; medians over measured passes only.

Read with care: pc-eng-002's passes carry no labels yet (Sean labels as he reads), so its rows show `—` for labeled passes and `0 of N` for rung-0 clean, because the label line fails for every unlabeled pass. Its Claude meters are the Agent tool's reported totals and include cached context, so they are not comparable with pc-eng-001's summed transcript figures (see the meter-source ticket).

## First trial round

Ruled on [#287](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/287), 2026-10-03, from the [open-models-per-seat brief](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/blob/14096e6c/vault/20_projects/research/2026-09-21-open-models-per-seat-role.md) and the [harness brief](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/blob/14096e6c/vault/20_projects/research/2026-09-21-harnesses-per-runtime.md). Every trial shadows a pass the train runs anyway, so this is a plan for real work, not a test bench.

**Host:** Systemcraft's eng-005 (return due 2026-12-04). Its Open declares the four trials in the pass budget as `shadow_of` the named seats' passes, outside the funded cap. A shadow never blocks the train.

| Trial | Model | Shadows (family) | Row | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GLM-5.3 | Design Strategist (framing) | 4, Codex → OpenRouter | its strongest family on every independent board; proves row 4's wire |
| 2 | Kimi K3 | Ops & Economics Modeler (quantitative) | 4, Codex → OpenRouter | its strongest family; the bluff-rate filter keeps it off evidence grading |
| 3 | MiMo-V2.6-Pro | Architecture Advisor (architecture) | 6, Pi → OpenRouter | #1 open on the composite index at the lowest price; the first Pi pass |
| 4 | Qwen3.8-27B (`qwen3.8-27b-64k`, local) | Interaction & Trust Designer (trust design) | 6, Pi → Ollama on the MBP | the only $0 route; a corpus-carried Sonnet-baseline seat; settles the tool-call-streaming claim |
| — | none | Evals & Evidence Architect (evidence grading) | — | runs the co-sign gate; stays on its ruled baseline this round |

**Delivery breakdown** (a fifth trial, Productcraft only): at the execution-breakdown Open that follows eng-005's return, GLM-5.3 on row 4 shadows the Delivery & Execution pass, **unless GLM-5.3 misses on eng-005**, in which case the best eng-005 performer takes the slot. Set now so the result cannot pick its own rule. Same $15 cap.

**Bluff-rate filter.** A model whose independent hallucination rate (AA-Omniscience: wrong answers as a share of non-correct responses) is **above 35%** is not trialled on an evidence-grading seat. A model with no published figure is untested and allowed. Today that rules out Kimi K3 (51%) and DeepSeek V4 Pro 0813 (95%); GLM-5.3 (30%) clears it.

**Scoreboard, fixed before the round runs:**

| Per trial | Means | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **promotable** | the trial passes Sean's blind read and the baseline fails | promotable under protocol step 5 |
| **match** | both pass blind, both rung-0 clean | `substitution-eligible` |
| **match on the cheap** | a match at under $5 cash (OpenRouter) or $0 (local) | as match, flagged as the cost win |
| **miss** | the trial fails blind | a labeled fail; its critique feeds rung 1 |

The round reads **pleasantly surprised** at 2 or more of 4 trials at match or better with at least one of them Qwen or a match on the cheap; **as expected** at 1 of 4; **disappointed** at 0 of 4 (a real result too: Devcraft starts on the ruled runtimes). Wall-clock is recorded and not scored this round: Qwen runs at about 6 tokens per second on the MBP (probe 2026-10-03), so a full pass can take an hour or more.

**Setup and side experiments.** The Codex isolation check runs as trial 1's setup (above). The first `claude -p` pass (row 2) and Hermes (row 7) move to [runtime trials per craft team](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/329), with DeepSeek V4 Pro 0813, benched for coding-heavy teams. Jev's log-only shadow guard is Devcraft's, not this round's.

## Ruled out

| What | Why | What would reopen it |
|---|---|---|
| **Aider** | No read tool: the coordinator would pre-list corpus files with `--read`, so `## Corpus read` stops being what the seat chose and rung-0 line 5 loses its meaning | An *edit-only* pass kind, defined on the record template, where the inputs are pre-listed by law |
| **Jev** (TypeSafe AI) as a seat runtime | A non-generative decision model — choice, score or yes/no from a fed state, no text out. A seat pass, a co-sign, an audit and a gate all write prose, so it cannot carry any of them; rung 0 is deterministic with no model by law, so it has no place there either | Nothing on this registry. Its one Productcraft slot is the unearned rung-2 judge for `overclaimed-pointer` (map fog); its strongest fit is a Devcraft `PreToolUse` shadow guard, which is Devcraft's map, not this one |
| `pi-claude-bridge`, `pi-anthropic-auth` | Reuse Claude Pro/Max auth from a non-Anthropic client; whether that is within the subscription terms was **not found in primary sources** | A primary-source answer on the terms, recorded on the Pi row |
| Codex `ultra` effort | Auto-delegates sub-tasks, breaking one-invocation-one-seat (#267) | A ruling, not a trial |
| `gpt-6-astra` as any default | Rejected by the installed binary; no studio precedent | A Codex upgrade that accepts it, then a dated substitution on a named pass |
| Any memory add-on, on any row | Cross-session state contradicts the fresh-context rule every audit runs under | Never for a seat pass |

## Rules that carry over unchanged

- **A gate runs on a different lineage than the artifact's author** (#267's anchor-vendor rule), and so does a verification pass (#296 clause 4). A trial's audit or gate too.
- **No silent deviations.** A pass on any row other than the seat file's `model:` is a deviation with a one-line why against a named trigger, or a dated owner-approved substitution, or a declared trial — one of the three, in the Route entry.
- **Every invocation records its runtime and its meter line** — the row's `runtime:` string, the launch form verbatim, and the meter as the runtime reported it or `UNMEASURED`. Never an estimate. Dollar figures never enter a record (#272); an API-billed row puts its measured cash on the engagement's Close cost line.
- **The degradation ladder applies on any row.** A runtime that cannot read the private corpus or ledger says so (`grounding: manifest-only | none`) and never fabricates a citation. Every row above reads both today because they sit inside the repo; a row that could not would say so in its "Reads" column.

## Meter-source vocabulary

The authority for `meter_source` in every pass record; [trace/tracekit/engagement.py](../trace/tracekit/engagement.py) mirrors it as `METER_SOURCES` and `trace/tests/test_registry.py` fails when the two drift. A value names **where the number came from**, never how good it is.

| Value | Row | What the coordinator copies |
|---|---|---|
| `Agent-tool usage` | 1 | the one total the Agent tool's usage field reports |
| `claude -p result.usage` | 2 | `input_tokens` → `input`, `output_tokens` → `output`, `cache_read_input_tokens` → `cached`, from the `result` message |
| `codex turn.completed.usage` | 3, 4, 5 | `input_tokens` → `input`, `output_tokens` → `output`, `cached_input_tokens` → `cached`, from the last `turn.completed` event in the JSONL |
| `codex footer` | 3, 4, 5 (plain form) | the `tokens used` number on stderr → `total` |
| `pi message_end usage` | 6 | the summed `usage` of assistant messages: `input`, `output`, `cacheRead` → `cached` |
| `hermes usage-file` | 7 | `input_tokens` → `input`, `output_tokens` → `output`, `cache_read_tokens` → `cached`, top level only; `total_including_auxiliary` goes in `## Notes` |
| `gemini stats.tokens` | 8 | per model: `prompt` → `input`, `candidates` → `output`, `cached` → `cached`, summed across models |
| `UNMEASURED` | any | `meter: null` — the runtime reported nothing the coordinator could copy |
