"""Rung 0 of the ladder — deterministic checks, no model, no network (#272 decision 7).

Each check prints pass or fail with a count. A finding names the pass and the
thing, so the coordinator can fix the record rather than guess. What rung 0
cannot verify (an item only present in a superseded revision, which the
overwrite-in-place rule of #274 leaves unreadable) is counted and reported as
unverifiable, never quietly passed and never failed: a replay check over the
raw transcript is a later rung.
