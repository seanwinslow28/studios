"""Registry numbers — the runtime × seat table the runtime registry reads (#272 decision 9, built on #286).

The registry (`craftwork/templates/runtime-registry.md`) carries one row per
runtime route and, under § Numbers, what each runtime has actually done on real
work. Those numbers are never typed by hand: this module derives them from the
pass records and the labels file of one or more engagements, in the shapes the
design ratified — labeled passes as **counts** ("3 of 4", no percentage anywhere,
the design forbids one below ten and nothing here ever prints one), the rung-0
clean count, median runtime-reported tokens and wall-clock over measured passes,
meter availability, trials and promotions.

A promotion is a dated, owner-approved substitution (#272 decision 9) and lives
in the trial record's `## Notes` as a line beginning `promoted:`; the count here
reads that line and nothing else. A trial whose blind label passes while its
baseline's fails is *promotable*, which is a fact about the labels and is
counted separately.
