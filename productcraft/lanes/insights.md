# Lane manifest — Insights & Analytics

Mandatory first read for the [Insights & Analytics seat](../bench/insights-analytics.md).
Entries are title + pointer + one-line when-to-read — shelf labels, never the books: the
content lives in the private corpus (`../corpus/`, gitignored), so pointers resolve only on
a machine that has it (degradation ladder otherwise). Follow only the pointers relevant to
the task. Seats stop at `## Reading path`; that section is the owner's.

This lane's two sources have opposite biases. Amplitude publishes method in order to sell a
tool; Kohavi publishes measured results in order to stop people fooling themselves. Read the
first for definitions and the second for whether a number can be believed.

## Choosing and defining a metric

- **North star vs. inputs: the dependent-variable rule** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — a stakeholder asks the seat to move the headline metric directly, or proposes a metric the team can push on in a sprint.
- **The seven-point metric checklist** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — a candidate metric arrives and needs a pass/fail gate before anyone writes instrumentation for it.
- **Writing a metric definition that survives a query** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — a metric exists as a phrase everyone agrees on but no two people would compute the same way.
- **Input sets: breadth / depth / frequency / efficiency** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — proposing an input set, or saying whether an existing one is pitched too high or too low.

## Retention, lifecycle and instrumentation

- **Critical event, usage interval, and the three retention curves** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — a retention figure is quoted without stating which computation produced it, or you are choosing a denominator for a new one.
- **Lifecycle states and the pulse ratio** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — active-user counts are climbing and someone needs an honest answer to whether that is growth.
- **Event taxonomy and the pre-analysis instrumentation audit** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — before running any analysis on a product whose tracking plan the seat did not design.

## Designing an experiment and its OEC

- **Seven Pitfalls to Avoid When Running Controlled Experiments on the Web (KDD 2009)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — drafting an OEC (the litmus test lives here), or ramp-up periods, bots or survey ratings are in the analysis.
- **Online Controlled Experiments and A/B Tests — encyclopedia entry (2023)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — the pre-flight checklist: twelve trust questions and six sensitivity levers, shorter than any of the papers.
- **Seven Rules of Thumb for Web Site Experimenters (KDD 2014)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — before promising a stakeholder how big a win to expect, or when someone calls a good-CTR module clearly good for users.
- **Rule #4 slowdown-experiment method** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — a feature ships slower than its control and the latency penalty needs pricing separately from the feature's effect.

## Trust: detecting a broken experiment

- **Diagnosing Sample Ratio Mismatch: A Taxonomy and Rules of Thumb (KDD 2019)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — the moment a scorecard shows an unexpected split, and when reviewing any platform's data-quality alerting.
- **Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments: Five Puzzling Outcomes Explained (KDD 2012)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — an experiment's early days appear to trend, running longer is proposed to buy power, or a metric moved that the change should not have touched.
- **A/B Testing Intuition Busters (KDD 2022)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — before quoting a p-value or a confidence number to anyone, and whenever a vendor tool or a small test is doing the persuading.

## Long horizons and platform scale

- **Pitfalls of Long-Term Online Controlled Experiments (IEEE Big Data 2016)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — before agreeing to a multi-month holdout or a post-period learning-effect measurement.
- **Online Controlled Experiments at Large Scale (KDD 2013)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — experiment volume is outgrowing the review process: interaction detection, alert thresholds, and what the platform costs.
- **Online Experimentation at Microsoft (Think Week 2009)** — [`kohavi-papers.md`](../corpus/canon/kohavi-papers.md) — an organization is arguing about whether to measure at all; the one-third success rate originates here.

## Reading these sources honestly

- **Correlation ranked as drivers** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — a "what drives retention" finding is about to leave the seat, or a tool has handed back a ranked list of predictive actions.
- **Vendor composites: PES, focus metrics, metric trees** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — a stakeholder imports a vendor's packaged number, or asks why the studio will not report one.
- **Gaps and vendor-bias flags in this distillate** — [`amplitude-north-star.md`](../corpus/canon/amplitude-north-star.md) — before citing anything from the Amplitude file in a deliverable that leaves the studio.

## Book layer

Two books are ingested. Kohavi is the systematic treatment the free papers argue toward,
for products with enough traffic to run a controlled test. Hubbard covers what Kohavi
cannot: a pilot too small for any test, and a single measurer with no second reviewer.

**Standing note on Hubbard.** The Rule of Five and the single-draw majority rule (the Urn of
Mystery) assume the sample was drawn at random from the population. A hand-recruited pilot
is not a random draw, so neither rule's stated confidence carries over to it. Use them to
bound what random draws would say, never as the reading of the pilot itself.

- **Kohavi, Tang & Xu, *Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments* — ch. 3, 6, 7, 21** — [`books/trustworthy-online-controlled-experiments/`](../corpus/books/trustworthy-online-controlled-experiments/) — defining metrics, building an OEC, or deciding whether a measured result can be trusted at all.
- **Hubbard, *How to Measure Anything* — ch. 3, 9** — [`books/how-to-measure-anything/`](../corpus/books/how-to-measure-anything/) — a pilot of 5 to 30 users is all the data there is, and it has to be known which small-sample rules apply and what hand-picked recruitment breaks.
- **Hubbard, *How to Measure Anything* — ch. 5** — [`books/how-to-measure-anything/`](../corpus/books/how-to-measure-anything/) — before trusting your own ranges or probabilities with no second reviewer; run the book's `calibration-kit.md`.
- **Hubbard, *How to Measure Anything* — ch. 7** — [`books/how-to-measure-anything/`](../corpus/books/how-to-measure-anything/) — before commissioning any measurement: whether it is worth running, and how much it should cost.
- **Hubbard, *How to Measure Anything* — ch. 10** — [`books/how-to-measure-anything/`](../corpus/books/how-to-measure-anything/) — combining a calibrated prior with a handful of observations, or sanity-checking a "significant" result against a low prior.
- **Hubbard, *How to Measure Anything* — ch. 12** — [`books/how-to-measure-anything/`](../corpus/books/how-to-measure-anything/) — the instrument is someone's judgment (an expert, a panel, an LLM grader) and has to be validated rather than trusted.
- **Ellis & Brown, *Hacking Growth* — ch. 2, 3, 6** — [`books/hacking-growth/`](../corpus/books/hacking-growth/) — designing user surveys, finding a behavioral threshold, or diagnosing where users drop off.
- **Rumelt, *Good Strategy Bad Strategy* — ch. 2, 16** — [`books/good-strategy-bad-strategy/`](../corpus/books/good-strategy-bad-strategy/) — hunting the reframe or anomaly that turns a known situation into advantage.

**Read the Kohavi equations with care — but the two that mattered most are now readable.**
Every numbered equation was flattened in capture. Where the surrounding prose named every
variable the formula was reconstructed and is labelled as a reconstruction in that
chapter's OCR note. The two the distillation refused to guess at — the delta-method
variance estimator and the dilution formulas — were **read back from the page images on
2026-09-21 and transcribed**, each with the notation table it depends on, in chs. 18 and
20; those are transcriptions, not reconstructions, and they are now the authority on
notation wherever the body text's mangled subscripts disagree. Table 2.1's cells were
recovered the same day and sit in ch. 2. Everything else still stands: the remaining
equations are reconstructions or absent, and the *Hacking Growth* cohort worksheet is
corrupted and contradicts its own prose — its numbers come from the narration, not the
table.

Hubbard's figures survive only as images; the load-bearing ones were read back, including
Exhibit 9.5 (checked cell by cell and recomputed) and every appendix calibration key. Four
flagged pages stay unresolved, and three pages the capture report did not flag lost lines
that could not be recovered — each is named in the distillate. The multi-variable
value-of-information method, and any calibration test beyond the appendix, need the
book's website spreadsheets, which are not in the corpus. A few of the book's own exhibits
contradict its prose (one survey table's counts exceed its possible maximum); flagged in
place. Vintage is 2014: tool lists, prediction markets and its view of AI as a judge.

### Next

- Rodrigues, *Product Analytics* (2020) — metric design to causal inference end-to-end, in R; the deepest analytics text after Kohavi.
- Croll & Yoskovitz, *Lean Analytics* — six models by five stages with benchmarks; the benchmarks are 2013-stale, the frameworks hold. Held on 2026-09-28: its app model assumes installs and in-app revenue, so it does not reach a pre-revenue cost case.
