# Check record template — co-signs and audits

The artifact of a **co-sign** or **audit** pass: what the checking seat saw, what it passed or bounced, what it attacked and what held. Written by the checking seat in a fresh-context invocation that receives artifacts only, never the drafting conversation. Two of the train's three co-sign touches use it (Insights on the Discovery evidence, `<eng>.cosign-discovery`; the Strategist on the OKR translation, `<eng>.cosign-okr`); the third — Insights on the Strategist's outcomes — is the outcome-to-metric table inside the [metrics & evidence plan](metrics-evidence-plan.md). Every trailing audit uses it (`<eng>.audit-<artifact-slug>`). The record travels beside the checked artifact through the train (a downstream seat reads the grades) and **stays behind at a handoff**, per the contract. The coordinator transcribes the verdict into the checked artifact's `cosign:` or `audit:` field and into the pass record's `checks`.

A check never edits the checked artifact: a bounce or a material defect is a loopback to its drafting seat, and **one repair round per artifact per check** is the cap (#296 clause 1). A `verify` pass runs on the vendor that did **not** write the repair (clause 4) — the checker changes vendor, not the repairer. Header fields per [artifact-header.md](artifact-header.md).

## Verdict line

One of: `CO-SIGN PASS` · `CO-SIGN BOUNCE — <n> claims` · `AUDIT CLEAN — stake held` · `AUDIT LOOPBACK — <n> material` · `AUDIT NOTES ONLY`. Rendered per Systemcraft's status vocabulary: the line, then **Means**, then **Does not mean / Next**.

## Claims or findings

Co-sign: one row per claim in the anchor section. Audit: one row per finding, severity **MATERIAL** (loops back) or **NOTE**.

| # | Claim or finding | Section | Grade or severity | Evidence pointer opened | Verdict | What would pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | | Part 3 | observed-behavior | `evidence/…` | pass | |
| C4 | | Part 3 | stated-preference | `evidence/…` | bounce | a past-behavior instance from ≥ 3 participants |

## What was attacked and held

Being unable to find a defect is a finding: name what was attacked, how, and why it held.

## Loopback

The one message to the drafting seat: which rows, what evidence, what would pass. Empty on a clean check — say "none".

## Verification (`stance: verify` only — omit the section entirely on a first-sight check)

Round two is a **verification pass, not a fresh audit** (#296 clause 2). Exactly three duties, and the third is a duty:

1. **Rule each repair** `holds` or `residual` — one row per finding the first-sight check raised, in its original numbering. `holds` closes it. `residual` says what still fails and what would pass.
2. **Attack the text the repair changed** — that text only. A defect found outside it is a **gate residual**, recorded in the table below and carried to the next scheduled gate as a candidate acceptance; it is never a loopback and never a new material round.
3. **Stop.** No re-reading of the whole artifact, no reopening a finding the first-sight check passed, no new checklist sweep.

| # | First-sight finding | Repair | holds \| residual | If residual: what still fails, what would pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | | | holds | |

| Outside the changed text | Section | Severity | Carried to | Why it is not a loopback |
|---|---|---|---|---|

**The series line**, for the coordinator's gate report: `round <n> / <findings> findings / <lines or sections> changed`. A series that does not shrink is a variance question to Sean, never another round.

meter: <runtime> · <tokens> · <wall-clock>
```

## Evidence-strength grades

The four-rung scale Insights attaches at touch one and every seat uses to grade its own inputs before Insights audits them. Named for what the evidence *is*, never for how confident anyone feels.

| Grade | The evidence is | May carry |
|---|---|---|
| `observed-behavior` | Past behavior seen directly — usage data, a transcript of the act, an observed session — with a pointer | a bet, an opportunity, a solution |
| `reported-behavior` | A participant's account of a specific past instance, in their words, with a pointer | a bet or opportunity when ≥ 3 participants report it unprompted; else a hypothesis |
| `stated-preference` | An opinion, a "would you", a rating | a hypothesis only — never a bet |
| `inferred` | The team's inference with no participant source | a hypothesis only, labeled as the team's |

A claim graded `stated-preference` or `inferred` that sits under a bet in the Discovery tree **bounces**. The grade is written here and transcribed into the Discovery packet's `Grade (Insights)` column on the redraft.

## Red-team checklist (the close gate reads every check record)

- **Generous grading** — a `reported-behavior` grade on a claim whose pointer is a summary, or whose participants are unnamed.
- **A check that saw the conversation** — inputs listing anything but artifacts (the pass record's `withheld` must include the drafting conversation).
- **Silent pass** — `What was attacked and held` empty on a clean verdict.
- **Severity laundering** — a material defect filed as a NOTE to avoid the cascade.
- **The stake not answered** — an audit record whose rows never address the stake sentence.
- **A verification pass that re-audited** — `stance: verify` with findings from text the repair never touched filed as material, or a passed first-sight finding reopened.
- **A second loopback on one check** — the repair cap spent and a third round requested instead of a gate residual or a question to Sean.
