# Execution breakdown template

Owned by the **Delivery & Execution Lead** (seat contract, [#266](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/266)). The artifact of the **execution-breakdown engagement**: Delivery only, opened when Systemcraft's return has landed in `handoff/inbound/`, receiving the complete design train plus the frozen return. Delivery runs the **intake check** first (per [the handoff contract](../../craftwork/handoff-contract.md)), writes `informed_by` and flips overturned entries, then turns the design into buildable work: **epics → stories with subtasks in a design set and an implementation set → a first sprint plan**, filed as issues in the target's tracker. One ledger entry; **no audit cycle, no gate** — this engagement creates the implementation candidate that Systemcraft's Gate 3 waits for. A one-off Delivery pass mid-build (stories, release notes, retros) uses the story and sprint sections of this template alone.

Design-set stories are a **flagged placeholder** until a Designcraft team exists. An overturn that demands a new *product* decision is a loopback to the owning seat as a one-off, never answered here. Header fields per [artifact-header.md](artifact-header.md).

## Intake check

Can this seat do its job from the return? State the crossing state and, if `input-required`, exactly what is missing by ask id. A check, not an audit — it never judges Systemcraft's decision.

## Overturned assumptions

| Systemcraft entry | Productcraft entry it overturns | What changes here | Needs a product decision? (→ one-off to which seat) |
|---|---|---|---|

## Epics

| Epic | Outcome served (id) | Key result (id) | In first slice? | Systemcraft hold it closes |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Stories

Every story names its epic, its acceptance in observable terms, its set, and its tracker issue once filed.

**Design set** — *placeholder until Designcraft exists; flagged, not delegated.*

| Id | Epic | Story | Acceptance | Size | Depends on | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

**Implementation set**

| Id | Epic | Story | Acceptance | Size | Depends on | Issue |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Subtasks live in the tracker under their story, never here.

## First sprint plan

Goal in one line, the key result it moves, capacity, the stories in, the stories consciously out, and the risk that would end the sprint early.

| In | Out (and why) | Risk |
|---|---|---|

## Filed

| Issue | Story id | Filed at |
|---|---|---|

## Implementation candidate

Which stories, once shipped, constitute the candidate Systemcraft's Gate 3 will fire on, and who writes its `candidate-note.md` per the contract.

## Moves

<!-- MACHINE-READ. The rung-0 checker (craftwork/trace/check.py) parses this section line by line
     against the pass's recorded inputs. Move lines only, one per line, from the five-op grammar in
     artifact-header.md § Moves — or the single `origin draft, no upstream` line. A sentence of prose
     here is a malformed line and a finding, not a note: put the note in the record's ## Notes. -->

- kept — <upstream item> from pc-eng-001.roadmap
- added — <story> from eng-004.return ask Q2
- split — <upstream item> → <story>, <story> from pc-eng-001.roadmap
- merged — <upstream item> + <upstream item> → <epic> from pc-eng-001.roadmap
- dropped — <upstream item> from pc-eng-001.roadmap; <why — an overturned assumption by entry id>

## Red-team checklist (no gate fires here; the close gate of the *next* full train and Systemcraft's Gate 3 look back at it)

- **A story with no outcome** — an epic serving no key result; scope that walked in during the wait.
- **Product decisions taken in the breakdown** — an overturned assumption resolved here instead of looped back.
- **Holds that never close** — a Systemcraft implementation hold no epic names.
- **Acceptance by feeling** — an acceptance cell that cannot be observed.
- **Design work delegated** — a design-set story assigned as if a Designcraft seat existed.
- **A candidate nobody defined** — the implementation-candidate section empty.
