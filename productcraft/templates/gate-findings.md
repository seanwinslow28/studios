# Gate findings template — the red-team gate's artifact

The findings file a **red-team gate** writes: stateless, on the vendor that did not last write the anchor artifact (Codex GPT-5.6 Sol High by default; a fresh-context Opus 5.5 subagent when the anchor was last written on Codex), receiving only the artifacts and the shared [red-team protocol](../../craftwork/templates/red-team-protocol.md), never the drafting conversation. Productcraft's schedule: **Gate 1 — strategy sign-off** (`<eng>.gate-1`, anchor the Strategy & POV doc, after stage 3), **Gate 2 — pre-handoff** (`<eng>.gate-2`, anchor the handoff brief, only when a brief exists), the **close gate** (`<eng>.gate-close`, the whole train), and an audit engagement's single **audit-close gate**. Every gate also writes its ledger entry (`seat: red-team-gate`) naming its vendor and why; this file is the authoritative record of the verdict and the entry is derived from it.

Posture is inherited: *find the strongest case that this fails; being unable to find a material flaw is a finding — state what you attacked and why it held*; propose the steel-man alternative.

That posture stands as written — [#296](https://github.com/seanwinslow28/code-brain/issues/296) tested it against pc-eng-001 and found it is not what made the audit ladder unbounded: it says *show your work either way*, `What was attacked and held` is the exit it provides, and one first-sight audit returned NOTES ONLY on a fresh artifact. What the gate *does* now carry is the convergence rule's reporting duty: the series table below, and the de-duplication line under Findings.

## Verdict line

Typed, so a strategy verdict can never be quoted as a train verdict: `STRATEGY | HANDOFF | TRAIN | AUDIT` × `PASS | PASS WITH ACCEPTANCES | FAIL` + ` — QUALITY VERDICT ONLY`, then scope and authority, then **Means** and **Does not mean / Next**, per Systemcraft's status vocabulary. `NOT FIRED — TRIGGER NOT MET` is a state, not a verdict (a Gate 2 with no brief). FAIL → the owning seat redrafts one tier up and the gate re-runs.

## Findings

| # | Severity | Artifact and section | Finding | Attack it came from (template checklist line) | Disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | CRITICAL \| MATERIAL \| NOTE | pc-eng-001.strategy § Strategic bets | | "A point of view that cannot be wrong" | redraft \| accepted by Sean <date>: <why> \| noted |

CRITICAL blocks the gate. MATERIAL is fixed, or Sean explicitly accepts it with a recorded why. Every finding names the checklist line it came from — an attack with no home in a template is a finding against the templates folder.

**Duplicates route, they never recount** (#296 clause 7, from the close gate's own practice on pc-eng-001). A finding that appears in more than one check — a residual an audit raised and the gate found again, the same defect in two artifacts — gets **one row, one owner, one disposition**, with every appearance named in it. The count at the top of this file is findings, not appearances.

## Check series (every artifact this gate is answerable for)

The stopping rule made visible (#296 clause 6). One row per check series that ran on an artifact in scope, from its check records' series lines. A series that did not shrink is a **variance question to Sean**, raised here, never another round.

| Artifact | Check | Rounds | Findings by round | Repair size by round | Ended on | Gate residuals carried |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| pc-eng-001.strategy | audit-strategy | 2 | 7 → 1 | 9 sections → 1 clause | verification held | 3 |

Every **gate residual** in that last column appears in Findings above as a candidate acceptance, with its origin check named. A residual a later round already repaired is closed here as **stale**, not dispositioned (clause 7).

## Implementation holds

Evidence only a built thing can produce, recorded as an obligation, never a severity: owner, trigger, required record, the query or test, the fail-closed consequence. A design can pass with holds; nothing launches while a hard hold is open.

| Hold | Owner | Trigger | Required record | Query or test | If unmet |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Steel-man alternative

The strongest competing design the train did not choose, in one paragraph, and why the train's choice survives it — or does not.

## What was attacked and held

Per artifact: the attacks run, and why each held. Empty is a defect.

## Six months on

"Name the most likely way this is quietly failing six months after launch." One paragraph; the metric that would show it; whether the Insights plan carries that metric.

meter: <runtime> · <tokens> · <wall-clock>
```

## Whole-train attacks (close gate; Gate 1 and Gate 2 run their anchors' template checklists plus the cross-artifact rows)

- **Cross-artifact contradictions** — positioning quoted differently downstream; a key result on a metric the Insights plan lacks; a business-case price that breaks a Growth loop; a roadmap slice with a Systemcraft layer and no brief; a cadence reading an artifact that does not exist.
- **The evidence chain** — a bet whose supporting claim was graded below `reported-behavior`, or whose claim id no longer exists after a redraft.
- **The cascade that did not fire** — an artifact below a loopback still at its old revision.
- **Checks that never ran** — a stage with no check record; a co-sign transcribed without a record; an audit at a lower tier than its auditor's baseline.
- **The steel-man** — a competing design that reaches the same outcome cheaper, and no artifact rules it out.
- **The quiet failure** — the six-months-on scenario with no metric that would reveal it.
- **Reasoning that crossed** — a brief or frozen copy carrying ledger text, transcripts, or the drafting conversation.
- **Process waste** — a series that ran past its stopping rule; a verification pass that re-audited whole text; a finding recounted per appearance; a defect the studio's own template or kit caused. Coded in the labels file from the process-waste family, not graded as a seat's failure ([craftwork/trace/taxonomy.md](../../craftwork/trace/taxonomy.md)).
