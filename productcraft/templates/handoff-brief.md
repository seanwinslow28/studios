# Handoff brief template

The outbound packet of [the handoff contract](../../craftwork/handoff-contract.md) under Productcraft's [binding for Systemcraft](handoff-binding-systemcraft.md). Owned by the **Delivery & Execution Lead**, written right after its OKR section is co-signed at stage 6 and before Leadership runs (or by the closing seat of an audit engagement). A typed packet of references: the six frozen artifact copies travel *beside* it in `handoff/outbound/artifacts/`, never inside it. The Codex red-team gate fires on this file before it crosses; Systemcraft's Design Strategist issues the crossing state on arrival.

Filled briefs are **private** (`ledger/engagements/<eng-id>/handoff/outbound/brief.md`); this template is public machinery. Brevity law applies: every section reads in a breath. The brief carries no reasoning — the why lives in the ledger entry that files it.

## The ask

Decisions Systemcraft owns, stated as questions, one per line, each with an id the return answers by.

| Id | Question | Why it is Systemcraft's |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | | |

## Referenced artifacts

The six frozen copies in `artifacts/`, by permanent id. The manifest holds the hashes; this table says what each one is for.

| Source id | Artifact | What Systemcraft should take from it |
|---|---|---|
| pc-eng-001.strategy | Strategy & POV doc | |
| pc-eng-001.discovery | Discovery packet (co-signed) | |
| pc-eng-001.insights | Metrics & evidence plan | |
| pc-eng-001.growth | Growth model & GTM plan | |
| pc-eng-001.business | Business case | |
| pc-eng-001.roadmap | Outcome roadmap (OKR section co-signed) | |

## Constraints

- **First shipping slice** — what ships first and by when (from the roadmap).
- **Metrics the eval plan must serve** — the input metrics by name (from the Insights plan).
- **Cash and pricing envelope** — what the design may cost to run and what it may charge (from the business case).
- **Non-goals inherited** — the strategy's non-goals Systemcraft must not design around.
- **Privacy and data** — what may not leave the org, what may not be logged.
- **Budget envelope** — optional; a pass-budget or spend cap Sean ratifies at Systemcraft's Open.

## Stays behind

Raw evidence pointers Systemcraft may follow on this disk but does not receive: one line per pointer, with the claim it supports.
```

## Filing

1. Freeze the six copies with the shared kit, never by hand: `python3 craftwork/trace/freeze.py copy --binding productcraft/templates/handoff-binding-systemcraft.md --out <eng>/handoff/outbound/artifacts <eng>/artifacts/strategy-pov.md=pc-eng-NNN.strategy …` (all six). It strips the process parts the binding names, writes `<source-id>--<slug>.md` stamped with `frozen_from`, `sha256` (the stripped copy), `source_sha256`, `frozen_at` and `stripped`, and prints the table that is `manifest.md`. Run `freeze.py show` first to see what each copy loses.
2. Write the ledger entry that decides the handoff (`hands_off_to: eng-NNN` once Systemcraft assigns the id; `none` on a no-handoff verdict, which still gets its entry).
3. Run the Codex gate on this file; record the verdict in `gate:` and in the entry's `## Checks`.
4. Copy `brief.md`, `manifest.md` and `artifacts/` into Systemcraft's engagement `handoff/inbound/`; open `crossing.md` on both sides with `crossed · <date> · delivery-execution · <one line>`.
5. Wait for the state. `input-required` → repair and re-cross (re-gate only if the ask changed). `rejected` → record it, retype or drop.

## Red-team checklist (Gate 2 anchor; runs on the vendor that did not last write the brief)

- **Product decisions in disguise** — an ask in `## The ask` that a Productcraft seat owns (pricing, positioning, an outcome); the brief may not export its own decisions.
- **Hash drift** — a frozen copy that fails `freeze.py verify`, or a referenced artifact at a revision the train has since staled (`verify <copy>=<artifact>` reports a moved source).
- **Constraints without a source** — a `## Constraints` line that no section of a referenced artifact states (first slice from the roadmap, metrics from the Insights plan, envelope from the business case, non-goals from the strategy).
- **Reasoning that crossed** — ledger text, a transcript, a check record, the drafting conversation, or a process note the binding's strip list missed, inside the brief or a frozen copy. The repair for a missed note is a new line in the binding, then a re-freeze.
- **Raw evidence that crossed** — anything under `## Stays behind` also present in `artifacts/`.
- **A return date with no variance path** — `return_by` set with no line saying what happens if it slips.
- **The silent layer** — the roadmap's first slice names a Systemcraft-owned layer the ask does not cover, or the ask covers a layer the slice does not contain.
- **Unanswerable asks** — a question with no id, or two questions under one id, so the return note cannot answer it.
