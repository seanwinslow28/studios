THESIS: one reader's desk sheet for one engagement; it refuses the span waterfall and the KPI-tile dashboard.
OWN-WORLD: the portfolio's dailies desk, verbatim tokens; ink-alpha carries magnitude, glyph and weight carry verdicts, the accent keeps its interaction-mark grammar only.
STORY: Sean reads the line, sees where the train broke, walks the rows, labels as he reads, exports rows.
FIRST VIEWPORT: masthead, the reading line, the labeling counter, then the first-failing-stage matrix beside the list of fails with their critiques.
FORM: one scrolling document with folded rows (confirmed by Sean 2026-09-11); seed n/a, prototype.
FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review and DESIGN.md.
