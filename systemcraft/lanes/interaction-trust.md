# Lane manifest — Interaction & Trust

Mandatory first read for the [Interaction & Trust Designer](../bench/interaction-trust-designer.md). This is the studio's free-canon-carried lane — HAX and PAIR are its spine and got the corpus build's deepest pass. Entries are title + pointer + one-line when-to-read — shelf labels, never the books: the content lives in the private corpus (`../corpus/`, gitignored), so pointers resolve only on a machine that has it (degradation ladder otherwise). Follow only the pointers relevant to the task.

## The HAX spine (Amershi 18 guidelines)

- **Why these guidelines exist (the framing)** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — the canonical argument for why classic usability principles break under AI uncertainty.
- **The four lifecycle phases** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — quick orientation across Initially / During / When wrong / Over time.
- **Initially — G1–G2** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — first-run expectation-setting: capability scope and quality communication.
- **During interaction — G3–G6** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — timing, context relevance, social norms, bias mitigation.
- **When wrong — G7–G11** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — the core of the lane: invocation, dismissal, correction, scoping under uncertainty, explanations.
- **Over time — G12–G18** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — memory, personalization, feedback loops, global controls, change notification.
- **How the guidelines were built and validated** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — provenance for citation, and where products systematically under-invest.
- **HAX Toolkit instruments** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — turning the principles into a prioritized, costed backlog.
- **Trade-offs and limits** — [`microsoft-hax.md`](../corpus/canon/microsoft-hax.md) — before claiming guideline compliance.

## The PAIR spine (People + AI Guidebook)

- **Mental Models** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — onboarding, expectation-setting copy, and anthropomorphism risk.
- **Explainability + Trust** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — the lane's core trust-calibration reference, including whether to show confidence at all.
- **Feedback + Control** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — designing feedback affordances and user control rights.
- **Errors + Graceful Failure** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — the failure-UX template's closest source: error taxonomy and paths forward.
- **GenAI (v3): Interaction Design Policies** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — guardrails for open-ended generative journeys, framed by the user's capacity to recover.
- **GenAI (v3): Bidirectional AI Feedback Loops** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — the user↔system feedback grid and echo-chamber countermeasures.
- **The 23 Design Patterns (quick reference)** — [`google-pair.md`](../corpus/canon/google-pair.md) — grab-a-pattern index grouped by design question.

## Applied failure-UX and defensive design

- **Defensive UX** — [`eugeneyan.md`](../corpus/canon/eugeneyan.md) — expectation-setting, dismissal, attribution on the user-facing surface.
- **Product Design and UX** — [`applied-llms.md`](../corpus/canon/applied-llms.md) — human-in-the-loop patterns and risk-calibrated rollout of AI surfaces.
- **User Feedback: The Data Flywheel** — [`eugeneyan.md`](../corpus/canon/eugeneyan.md) — capturing implicit and explicit feedback without eroding trust.

## Where trust meets evals (the audit stake)

- **Critique Shadowing: Building an LLM Judge** — [`hamel-evals.md`](../corpus/canon/hamel-evals.md) — auditing whether a judge reflects real user judgment.
- **Binary Pass/Fail Beats Likert Scales** — [`hamel-evals.md`](../corpus/canon/hamel-evals.md) — pushing back on rubrics that hide the metric-vs-user gap.
- **Who Validates the Validators (EvalGen and Criteria Drift)** — [`sh-reya.md`](../corpus/canon/sh-reya.md) — why evaluation criteria shift as humans grade, and what that does to trust claims.

## Book layer

This lane remains free-canon-carried (HAX + PAIR above are the spine); the books below supplement it.

- **Huyen, *AI Engineering* — ch. 5, 6, 10** — [`books/huyen-ai-engineering/`](../corpus/books/huyen-ai-engineering/) — prompt attacks and defenses, write-action gating, guardrails and feedback-loop hazards.
- **Berryman & Ziegler, *Prompt Engineering for LLMs* — ch. 3, 7, 8, 11** — [`books/berryman-prompt-engineering-for-llms/`](../corpus/books/berryman-prompt-engineering-for-llms/) — injection defense, system-message discipline, dangerous-tool sign-off, agent UX.
- **Nika, *Building AI-Powered Products* — ch. 1, 3, 8** — [`books/nika-building-ai-powered-products/`](../corpus/books/nika-building-ai-powered-products/) — probabilistic UX, responsible-AI practice, the autonomy dial and interaction patterns.
- **Huyen, *Designing Machine Learning Systems* — ch. 8, 11** — [`books/huyen-designing-machine-learning-systems/`](../corpus/books/huyen-designing-machine-learning-systems/) — degenerate feedback loops and ML UX patterns.
- **Alammar & Grootendorst, *Hands-On Large Language Models* — ch. 6, 7, 8** — [`books/alammar-hands-on-large-language-models/`](../corpus/books/alammar-hands-on-large-language-models/) — output verification, agent provenance, grounded citations as a trust mechanism.
